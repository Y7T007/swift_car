## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

```

### 3. Activate the Virtual Environment

On Windows:

```

On macOS/Linux:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 4. Install Dependencies

### 5. Set Up Local Environment Variables

If needed, set up your local environment variables for configuration (e.g., database credentials, secret keys).

### 6. Run Migrations (If Needed)

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### 7. Start the Development Server
